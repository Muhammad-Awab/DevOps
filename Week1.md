# Introduction to DevOps
## History of DevOps (Story time)
The history of DevOps can be traced back to the early 2000s, when Agile development methodologies were gaining popularity. While Agile helped to break down silos between developers and testers, it did not address the operational side of software development, leading to a divide between development and operations teams.

The term "DevOps" was first coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, a software developer who was frustrated by the lack of communication and collaboration between development and operations teams. Debois organized the first "DevOpsDays" conference in Belgium, which brought together developers, operations professionals, and other stakeholders to discuss the challenges of software development and operations.

In the years that followed, DevOps gained popularity as more organizations recognized the benefits of breaking down the silos between development and operations teams. DevOps practices and tools continued to evolve throughout the 2010s, with a growing focus on automation and continuous delivery. 

Today, DevOps has become a standard approach to software development and operations, with a wide range of tools and practices available to help teams work more collaboratively and efficiently. 

## DevOps

- DevOps is not a tool it is a mindset/philosophy/methodology that enables organizations to deliver high-quality software products and services at a faster pace.

- In simpler terms, integrating **software development** and **IT operations** team to automate infrastructure, workflows and code testing is DevOps. 

### Benefits of DevOps

- Improves collaboration among teams
- Since a lot of processes are automated it's easier to focus on improving the business
-	Accelerates software delivery 
-	Delivers high quality software
- Improves product reliability 

## The DevOps Cycle

**1. Plan:** 
Defining the objectives, requirements, and scope of the software project.
*Tools used: Jira, Trello, Asana*

**2.	Code:**
Writing and reviewing code for the software. It includes version control, code review, and collaboration among developers.
*Tools used: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab*

**3.	Build:** 
Compiling the code and generating executable files 
*Tools used: Gradle, Maven*

**4.	Test:** 
Testing for bugs and errors.
*Tools used: Selenium, JUni*

**5.	Release:** 
Preparing the software for release and production.
*Tools used: Jenkins*

**6.	Deploy:** 
Deploying the software to production environments.
*Tools used: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Chef, Puppet*

**7.	Operate:** 
Smooth production assurance.
*Tools used: Nagios, New Relic*

**8.	Monitor:** 
Monitoring for issues, bugs, and errors, and taking corrective action as needed.
*Tools used: Nagios*

## Stages of DevOps

**1.	Version Control:**
Collaborative coding, change/ update code. (GitHub) 

**2.	Continuous Integration (CI):** 
Integrating and testing code changes frequently to ensure that code is working as expected and there are no conflicts. (Jenkins)

**3.	Continuous Delivery (CD):** 
Deploying code changes to a testing environment, and automating the delivery process to ensure that new features and updates are released quickly and reliably.
(Maven integrated with Jenkins)

**4.	Continuous Deployment (CD):** 
Deploying code changes directly to production without any manual intervention, ensuring that code is delivered quickly and consistently. (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Kubernetes, Docker)

**5.	Continuous Monitoring:** 
Monitoring the software in production and identifying issues or bugs as they arise, so that they can be quickly resolved.
